                <h2>Neuroticism</h2>
                <p>Neuroticism measures susceptibility to negative emotion. Someone high in trait neuroticism is more likely to
                    suffer from anxiety, anger issues, depression, destructive self-consciousness, inability to indulge in moderation,
                    (food or TV binges) and/or an increased sense of vulnerability.

                <h2>Extroversion</h2>
                <p>Extroversion measures outward interest. A very extroverted person tends to direct their thoughts and actions 
                    outwards and typically towards others. Being high in extroversion can be characterized by friendliness, sociability,
                    assertiveness, high activity levels, a desire for excitement, and general cheerfulness.

                <h2>Openness</h2>
                <p>Openness is sometimes referred to as "openness to experience." Openness measures one's ability to understand and
                    grapple with new ideas. High openness is marked by a vivid imagination, artistic interest, intense emotion, desire
                    to experience new things, intellect, and, more generally, liberalism.

                <h2>Agreeableness</h2>
                <p>Agreeableness measures a tendency to avoid conflict and behave sympathetically. Someone high in agreeableness is
                    likely to be trustworthy and also place trust in others. They tend to act morally, care about others, work well 
                    in a team, and show great humility.
